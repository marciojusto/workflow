# Coding Principles

Behavioral bias, not checklist. Read before every implementation.

---

## Before Coding

- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- Multiple interpretations exist? Present all—don't pick silently.
- Simpler approach exists? Say so. Push back when warranted.
- Something unclear? Stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.
- User's approach seems wrong? Disagree honestly. Don't be sycophantic.

## During Implementation

### TDD (Test-Driven Development)

Default for every implementation task unless the Test Coverage Matrix says `none`.

Cycle:
1. **RED** — write a failing test derived from the spec/AC, not from the implementation
2. **GREEN** — implement the minimum code to make that test pass
3. **REFACTOR** — improve structure while keeping tests green

Rules:
- Tests first. If tests don’t exist yet, create them before the implementation.
- One behavior at a time. Don’t write the whole test suite before the first GREEN.
- Tests are the spec. Implementation conforms to tests; tests don’t bend to implementation.
- If a test is genuinely wrong, STOP and ask before changing it.

### Simplicity

- No features beyond what was asked
- No abstractions for single-use code
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" not requested
- No error handling for impossible scenarios
- 200 lines that could be 50? Rewrite it.

### Surgical Changes

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken
- Match existing style, even if you'd do differently
- Unrelated dead code noticed? Mention it—don't delete it
- Remove ONLY imports/variables/functions YOUR changes orphaned
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked

### Test Integrity

- NEVER weaken an existing test assertion to make it pass
- NEVER delete a test to reduce failure count
- NEVER use the test framework's skip/disable/pending mechanism to bypass a failing test
- NEVER modify a task's tests afterward to make the implementation pass
- If a test is genuinely wrong, STOP and confirm with the user before changing it
- Tests are the spec — implementation conforms to tests, not the other way around

### Goal-Driven

- Transform vague tasks into verifiable goals
- Multi-step work? State brief plan with verify checkpoints
- Every changed line must trace directly to user's request

## After Each Change

Ask: "Would senior engineer call this overcomplicated?"
If yes → simplify before proceeding.
